//! SANDBOX escape-defense SURFACE (Phase-3 G17-A1 wave-5b — SCAFFOLDING ONLY).
//!
//! **Scope re-narrate (post-G17-A1 mini-review 2026-05-06):** this PR ships
//! the SURFACE for r1-wsa-1 BLOCKER (ESC-7 + ESC-13) + r1-wsa-4 MAJOR
//! (ESC-16) — the `EscVector` enum, the typed
//! [`crate::primitives::sandbox::SandboxError::EscapeAttempt`] variant,
//! the [`run_esc7_check`] / [`run_esc13_check`] / [`run_esc16_check`]
//! defense entry points, the [`EscDefenseState`] per-call carrier, and
//! the cfg-gated [`crate::sandbox::testing_helpers`] surface. **The
//! production runtime arms that wire these defenses into the SANDBOX
//! execution path do NOT land in this PR.** r1-wsa-1 BLOCKER + r1-wsa-4
//! MAJOR remain OPEN until the wave-5c ESC runtime-arm wiring lands
//! (named at `docs/future/phase-3-backlog.md §6.1-followup`):
//!   * `SandboxStoreData` field add (carries [`EscDefenseState`] per-call).
//!   * `time` host-fn trampoline calls
//!     [`crate::sandbox::fingerprint::record_wallclock_write`] when
//!     writing wallclock-correlated values into guest memory (ESC-16
//!     side-table population).
//!   * Host-fn boundary calls [`run_all_checks`] (or the per-vector
//!     entry points) BEFORE the trampoline returns control to guest
//!     wasm, so detection fires before guest-observable side-effects.
//!   * Panic-catcher around the wasmtime fuel-meter callback maps
//!     callback-trap → `EscapeAttempt(Esc13StorePoison)` via injection
//!     of `EscapeAttemptMarker` into the `wasmtime::Error` cause chain
//!     (so [`crate::sandbox::trap_to_typed::map_call_error`] can unwrap).
//!   * `live_cap_check` callback through-thread for ESC-9 (cap-revoke
//!     mid-call) — fires at every host-fn boundary, not cached, per
//!     r1-wsa-3.
//!
//! Per pim-2 §3.6b: integration test pins under `crates/benten-eval/tests/sandbox_esc_*.rs`
//! that exercise these helpers against synthetic `EscDefenseState`
//! values are SHAPE pins (audit the helper logic). They are NOT
//! end-to-end load-bearing closure for r1-wsa-1 / r1-wsa-4 — the
//! end-to-end pins drive a real SANDBOX dispatch + assert observable
//! behavior, and they are `#[ignore]`'d with NAMED destination
//! "wave-5c ESC runtime-arm wiring (phase-3-backlog §6.1-followup)"
//! until that wave lands. The genuinely-production-wired piece in this
//! PR is the `Trap::StackOverflow` → `SandboxError::StackOverflow` arm
//! at [`crate::sandbox::trap_to_typed::map_call_error`] (closes
//! r1-wsa-7 — the dedicated typed variant for stack-overflow-via-recursion).
//!
//! The defenses live alongside the SANDBOX subsystem because they need
//! access to the per-call wasmtime `Store` shape + the host-fn
//! trampoline boundary; routing through the typed
//! [`crate::primitives::sandbox::SandboxError`] variant keeps audit
//! pipelines per-vector observable rather than collapsing into a
//! generic `ModuleInvalid` shape.
//!
//! ## Vectors
//!
//! - [`EscVector::Esc7FuelRefillViaReEntry`] — D-E + r1-wsa-1 BLOCKER:
//!   guest calls a host-fn whose dispatch path attempts to re-enter the
//!   guest `Store` and `add_fuel` mid-execution. Defense: a re-entry
//!   counter on `SandboxStoreData` (engine-side) trips the typed
//!   error before the fuel-refill takes effect.
//! - [`EscVector::Esc13StorePoison`] — D-E + r1-wsa-1 BLOCKER: a
//!   host-side fuel-meter callback panics or traps; the wasmtime
//!   `Store` enters a poisoned state. Defense: a panic-catcher around
//!   the fuel-meter callback maps callback-trap → typed
//!   `EscapeAttempt(Esc13StorePoison)` AND the next SANDBOX call
//!   constructs a fresh `Store` (poison-recovery — Phase-2b's
//!   per-call-`Store` lifecycle from D3-RESOLVED already gives the
//!   recovery path; ESC-13 just needs the typed-error attribution +
//!   the panic-catcher seam).
//! - [`EscVector::Esc16FingerprintCollapse`] — r1-wsa-4 MAJOR: guest
//!   reads a wallclock-correlated cell of guest-controlled linear
//!   memory (the fingerprint vector). Defense: the engine-side memory-
//!   read helper at [`crate::sandbox::fingerprint`] observes the read
//!   pattern; when the pattern matches the fingerprint-collapse
//!   signature, the next host-fn boundary fires the typed error
//!   BEFORE the side-channel becomes guest-observable.
//!
//! ## Why these are typed errors, not wasmtime traps
//!
//! Per sec-r1 D7, host-fn cap denials route through a typed-error
//! marker rather than a wasmtime trap so the engine accounting stays
//! clean (a wasmtime trap unwinds + may corrupt unrelated state). ESC
//! defenses follow the same discipline: detection happens at the
//! host-fn / fuel-meter boundary, NOT mid-instruction; the typed error
//! fires from the trampoline and the wasmtime `Store` is dropped
//! cleanly per the per-call lifecycle.
//!
//! ## Integration with the runtime arm (LANDS AT WAVE-5C — NOT THIS PR)
//!
//! Phase-2b SANDBOX shipped without any of these three defenses; the
//! corresponding ESC test bodies were deferred to phase-3-backlog
//! §6.1 + §6.4. G17-A1 ships ONLY the SURFACE pieces:
//!
//! 1. The [`EscVector`] enum + [`SandboxError::EscapeAttempt`] wrapper
//!    (catalog code `E_SANDBOX_ESCAPE_ATTEMPT`).
//! 2. The defense [`run_esc7_check`] / [`run_esc13_check`] /
//!    [`run_esc16_check`] entry points (currently test-callable only via
//!    `crate::sandbox::testing_helpers`; runtime callers land at
//!    wave-5c).
//! 3. The trap-routing arm at
//!    [`crate::sandbox::trap_to_typed::map_call_error`] (the
//!    `EscapeAttempt` marker is unwrapped at the cause-chain walk —
//!    but the marker is not yet INJECTED by any production trampoline;
//!    that wiring lands at wave-5c).
//!
//! The phased approach matches §3.6b end-to-end pin discipline: G17-A1
//! is correctly scoped IFF it is recognised as SCAFFOLDING + the
//! `Trap::StackOverflow` arm. r1-wsa-1 BLOCKER + r1-wsa-4 MAJOR closure
//! claim is RECALLED to wave-5c per the mini-review (CAP-EXEMPT
//! security-auditor + wasmtime-sandbox-auditor + correctness-engineer)
//! at `.addl/phase-3/r5-w5b-g17-a1-mini-review.json`. The genuinely-
//! production-wired piece is `Trap::StackOverflow` →
//! `SandboxError::StackOverflow` (r1-wsa-7 closure, separate from the
//! ESC vector cluster).
//!
//! `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`-gated per sec-pre-r1-05; the
//! wasm32 build cuts SANDBOX entirely.
