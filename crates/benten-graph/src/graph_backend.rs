//! [`GraphBackend`] — the umbrella storage-layer trait introduced at G13-A
//! (Phase-3 R5 wave-1 canary).
//!
//! ## Why this trait exists
//!
//! Phase-1 + Phase-2 shipped the storage layer with three composable
//! sub-traits — [`KVBackend`], [`NodeStore`], and [`EdgeStore`] — plus a
//! handful of inherent `RedbBackend`-specific methods
//! ([`RedbBackend::snapshot`], [`RedbBackend::register_subscriber`],
//! [`RedbBackend::put_node_with_context`], the closure-based
//! `RedbBackend::transaction`). The engine consumed `RedbBackend` directly,
//! which baked the redb dependency into every layer above — including the
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown` browser-target build (Phase-2-backlog §1.1
//! PHASE-3-BUNDLE-1).
//!
//! G13-A extracts an *umbrella* trait that composes the three subtraits
//! plus the previously-inherent methods that any production-grade graph
//! backend must expose. G13-B (the next wave) introduces
//! `EngineGeneric<B: GraphBackend>` and threads `B` through every consumer
//! site, freeing the engine from the concrete `RedbBackend` type and
//! letting `BrowserBackend` (G13-C) substitute in for the browser bundle.
//!
//! ## Design constraints (load-bearing — see `arch-r1-2` + `arch-r1-6`
//! + `D-PHASE-3-1` RESOLVED)
//!
//! 1. **Trait is intentionally NOT object-safe.** `type Error` + `type
//!    Snapshot` + `type Transaction` are associated types whose presence
//!    precludes `dyn GraphBackend` materialization at compile time. The
//!    engine consumes `GraphBackend` exclusively via the
//!    *generic-cascade* direction (`Engine<B: GraphBackend>` parameters),
//!    never `Arc<dyn GraphBackend>` / `Box<dyn GraphBackend>` —
//!    this is the load-bearing per-backend zero-cost-dispatch contract
//!    `D-PHASE-3-1` ratified.
//! 2. **`Self::Snapshot: Send + Sync + 'static`.** Snapshots are *owned*
//!    (no borrowing lifetime) so the engine can hold a snapshot across
//!    `.await` points + worker threads (SUBSCRIBE delivery, IVM
//!    materialization, cross-process WAIT-resume). RedbBackend pays a
//!    small clone (the `redb::ReadTransaction` is itself `'static` —
//!    backed by `Arc`-counted internals), per `arch-r1-6` recommendation
//!    (a) "make all snapshot types owned".
//! 3. **`Self::Error: std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static`.** Each
//!    backend surfaces its own typed error; the engine erases at the
//!    public boundary via `Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>` per
//!    `D-PHASE-3-1a` (`arch-r1-1` BLOCKER closure pinned at G13-B).
//! 4. **`Self::Transaction` is an owned handle type.** No lifetime
//!    parameter (would force GATs + cascade into `Engine<B>`). The
//!    handle is currently a marker (the closure-based
//!    [`RedbBackend::transaction`] inherent method remains the actual
//!    execution surface for Phase-3); future waves may evolve the
//!    handle into a borrowing-runner adapter without re-breaking the
//!    trait surface.
//!
//! ## What G13-A does NOT do
//!
//! - Does NOT add `Engine<B>` cascade (that is G13-B wave-2).
//! - Does NOT add `BrowserBackend` (that is G13-C wave-3).
//! - Does NOT change inherent `RedbBackend` method shapes (callers
//!   continue to enter via `RedbBackend::transaction(|tx| ...)` etc.).
//! - Does NOT change `KVBackend` / `NodeStore` / `EdgeStore` semantics.
//!
//! G13-A is purely an *umbrella-shape extraction* canary. The R5 wave-1
//! canary discipline (single agent, observable surface, mini-review)
//! mirrors Phase-2b G12-A precedent.
//!
//! ## Usage example (post-G13-B, illustrative only — not yet on main)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use benten_graph::{GraphBackend, RedbBackend};
//!
//! fn open_engine<B: GraphBackend>(backend: B) -> Engine<B> {
//!     // Engine accepts any backend that satisfies the umbrella surface.
//!     Engine::new(backend)
//! }
//!
//! let backend = RedbBackend::open_or_create("./data.redb").unwrap();
//! let engine = open_engine(backend);
//! ```

///
/// ## Object-safety contract
///
/// The associated types `Snapshot` / `Error` / `Transaction` make this
/// trait by-construction non-object-safe. The engine consumes
/// `GraphBackend` exclusively via the *generic-cascade* direction
/// (`Engine<B: GraphBackend>` parameters). Any future PR that adds
/// `dyn GraphBackend` / `Box<dyn GraphBackend>` / `Arc<dyn GraphBackend>`
/// references at the engine boundary fails the

/// landed at G13-B. See [`R3-A umbrella-trait scaffold
/// docs`](crate::graph_backend) for the full design narrative.
///
/// ## SemVer commitment (v1-stabilization — Fwd-2 #1022)
///
/// At the `v1` tag this trait's `pub` surface SemVer-locks. The
/// following commitments are written here so future PRs do not silently
/// drift the SemVer surface:
///
/// 1. **The trait remains non-object-safe post-v1.** The associated
///    types `Snapshot` / `Error` / `Transaction` are load-bearing for
///    the generic-cascade contract (`D-PHASE-3-1` RESOLVED). Adding a
///    default-method (e.g. a future `fn ping_health(&self) ->
///    Result<(), Self::Error>`) is a non-breaking minor; **removing any
///    of the three associated types** (e.g. to make snapshots a returned
///    trait object) is an object-safety-changing **major break** for the
///    generic-cascade direction and is forbidden pre-v1-stabilization
///    review. The `engine_does_not_reference_dyn_graph_backend_at_engine_boundary`
///    integration pin defends the consumption direction.
/// 2. **`snapshot()` infallible-with-`expect` shape** is a deliberate
///    pre-v1 tradeoff (see [`snapshot`](Self::snapshot)). Whether to flip
///    it to `Result<Self::Snapshot, Self::Error>` (so a Phase-4-Meta
///    light-client `mode-(c)` signed-checkpoint backend whose snapshot
///    can legitimately fail at open-time can surface that cleanly) is the
///    v1-stabilization fork named at `docs/future/phase-4-backlog.md
///    §4.53` + safe-1 #501.
/// 3. **`register_subscriber()` returns `()`** by intentional design
///    (see [`register_subscriber`](Self::register_subscriber)). Whether
///    to flip it to `Result<(), Self::Error>` (so a future
///    failure-surfacing subscriber — quota guard, duplicate-registration
///    guard — has a trait path) is the v1-stabilization fork named at
///    `docs/future/phase-4-backlog.md §4.60`.
///
/// ## Error-type alignment (Surf-1 #832)
///
/// `Self::Error` is constrained via supertrait `where`-bounds to be
/// **the same concrete type** as the inherited
/// [`KVBackend::Error`] / [`NodeStore::Error`] / [`EdgeStore::Error`].
/// This converts the prior documentation-only "implementors must align
/// all four by convention" into a compile-time guarantee: a backend
/// whose `KVBackend::Error` diverges from its `GraphBackend::Error`
/// fails to compile, preserving the `D-PHASE-3-1a` load-bearing contract
/// that "all read/write paths through a single `B: GraphBackend` give
/// you one unified typed-error surface."
///
/// ## Existing implementors
///
/// - [`RedbBackend`] (G13-A) — native redb-backed production storage.
/// - `BrowserBackend` (G13-C wave-3, FORTHCOMING) — in-RAM thin-client
///   cache for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
/// - `SnapshotBlobBackend` (G13-D wave-3, FORTHCOMING) — read-only
///   memory-mapped snapshot for the `engine_snapshot` direct-wire path.
///
/// ## Errors
///
/// All methods returning `Result<_, Self::Error>` use the per-backend
/// associated `Error` type. RedbBackend uses [`GraphError`]; future
/// backends declare their own.
