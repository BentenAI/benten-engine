//! # benten-ivm — Incremental View Maintenance
//!
//! Phase 1 ships five hand-written IVM views:
//!
//! 1. Capability grants per entity
//! 2. Event handler dispatch
//! 3. Content listing (paginated, sorted by `createdAt`) — load-bearing for
//!    the `crud('post')` exit criterion
//! 4. Governance inheritance
//! 5. Version-chain CURRENT pointer resolution
//!
//! All views subscribe to the graph change stream from `benten-graph` and
//! maintain their state incrementally. The evaluator is deliberately ignorant
//! of IVM; IVM is a subscriber, not an engine-internal feature.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! - [`view`] — [`View`] trait, [`ViewError`], [`ViewBudget`],
//!   [`ViewDefinition`], and the shared query/result shapes.
//! - [`budget`] — [`BudgetTracker`], the shared `remaining/original/stale`
//!   state machine used by every Phase-1 view (r6-ref R-major-02).
//! - [`subscriber`] — [`Subscriber`] / [`ChangeStreamSubscriber`], the
//!   fan-out that dispatches change events to every registered view.
//! - [`views`] — the five Phase 1 hand-written view implementations.
//!
//! The Phase-2 generalized Algorithm B (per-view strategy selection, Z-set
//! cancellation, user-registered views) is deliberately out of scope —
//! Phase 1 is hand-written maintainers for five concrete views.

// TODO(R4b): criterion benchmarks against RESULTS.md §1 targets — one target
// per view (capability lookup, event dispatch, content listing, governance
// traversal, version-current resolve). See mini-review g5-ivm-14.

// TODO(R4b): integration test that exercises cascade-deletion correctness
// (RESULTS.md §3). Construct a small graph, feed Create events through the
// subscriber, then the cascade of Delete events, and assert every view
// converges to empty. See mini-review g5-ivm-13.
//
// TODO(R4b): 4 rebuild-equivalence tests in view1/2/3/5 are R3 defects —
// they construct an empty rebuilt view and assert equality with a populated
// incremental one. Fixing requires event-replay, beyond the fix-pass scope.
// See mini-review g5-ivm-12.
